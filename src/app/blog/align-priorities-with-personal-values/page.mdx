## Overview

Aligning values with personal values means making conscious decisions to focus on activities, goals, and tasks that are consistent with what is most important to you. It means living in alignment with your core values, which are principles that guide your behavior, decisions, and goals.

Your personal values are the compass that points you toward your true north. When you align your priorities with your values, you’re ensuring that you’re moving in the direction that’s most meaningful and fulfilling to you.

- If family is a top value, you might prioritize spending quality time with loved ones, attending important events, and making decisions that benefit their well-being.
- **I**f creativity is a core value, you might prioritize activities that allow you to express yourself creatively, such as writing, painting, or designing**.**
- If health is a top value, you might prioritize self-care, exercise, and healthy eating habits.
- If integrity is a core value, you might prioritize being honest, transparent, and authentic in your interactions with others.

When you align your priorities with personal values, you:

- Feel more **fulfilled** and **satisfied** with your life
- Make decisions that are consistent with your goals and aspirations
- Experience a sense of **purpose** and **direction**
- Build **stronger relationships** with others who share your values

On the contrary, when your priorities are not aligned with your personal values:

- Unfulfilled, restless, or dissatisfied
- **Conflicted** or uncertain about your decisions
- Like you're living someone else's life or pursuing someone else's goals
- **Disconnected** from your own needs and desires
- Unhappy, stressed, or **anxious**
