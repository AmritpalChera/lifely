## The Article

Everything that makes us is because of decisions that we’ve made, the people around us made, and the people before us made. Decisions are powerful. The amount of `power` we have is a direct measure of the impact of our decisions on other people’s lives.

Every single moment in a our life is like a lattice of decisions that makes us who we are. Every single moment we have a binary choice; to take action or to not take action. There are endless opportunities in our lives where we take the action to commit or to not commit.

Decisions give us the opportunity to achieve our goals. Every single moment, we must make the right decision that moves us forward. Some decisions move us forward exponentially, others linearly, while some do not move us forward at all.

The decisions that move us forward exponentially are the hardest to make. They put us in unknown territory, where we have no experience in navigating the maze. The decisions that linearly move us forward are built upon hard decisions, where we seek to gain knowledge to map the unknown territory. 

With each knowledge step, we discover new things about the territory which influence our future decisions. These decisions impact the direction we choose to navigate, ultimately, if we choose to continue mapping the unknown territory or not. 

The direction we take has a great influence on discovering the paths that lead us to our end goal. Some paths are straightforward, leading us to discover many things very quickly. Other paths are full of turns and circles which take a longer amount of time to reach the end goal. For any territory, all paths lead to the same end goal — however the amount of effort and time each path requires greatly varies.

Our goal with any territory is to discover the shortest path that leads us to our destination. At first, for any given territory, it’s rare we instantly find this path. It will take us some time before we have enough knowledge to pick the right path that gets us to our destination.

There are ways in which we can accelerate our discovery. The fastest way is to partner with people who already mapped the territory. They guide us with execution and prevent us from picking lengthy roads.

    “A guide who passed the maze multiple times can save us years to get to our destination” — Amritpal Chera
    </p>
</blockquote>

Once we have enough knowledge and partnerships with people who’ve mapped different territories, our decision making abilities greatly increase.

    </p>

Our ability to make the correct decisions with quality execution gives us the power over many others who never mapped the territory. This by itself increases the power of our decisions as we continue to partner with others who guide us through different territories.

Ultimately, it’s in our nature to grow and life presents us with limitless opportunities to fulfill our nature. Our limitations are determined by our ability to make hard decisions that lead us to discover the fastest path to *growth*.
