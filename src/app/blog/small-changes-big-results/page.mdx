## Example of Positive Habits

**Morning Journaling**: Spend 10 minutes each morning writing down your thoughts, goals, and gratitudes.

**Daily Exercise**: Commit to 30 minutes of physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga.

**Reading Habit**: Read for 20 minutes each day, whether it's a book, article, or even a blog post.

**Gratitude Practice**: Take 5 minutes each day to reflect on the things you're thankful for.

**Healthy Eating**: Prepare a healthy meal or snack each day, such as a salad or a piece of fruit.

## How To Create Positive Habits

Here are some tips to help you create positive habits:

**Start Small:** Begin with tiny, achievable habits that you can realistically stick to.

**Make it Specific:** Define your habits clearly, so you know exactly what you need to do.

**Create a Schedule:** Choose a specific time and day for your habit, and stick to it.

**Track Your Progress:** Keep a habit tracker or journal to monitor your progress and stay motivated.

**Celebrate Milestones:** Reward yourself for reaching milestones, such as completing a week or a month of your habit.

Setting good goals can accelerate the process of adapting small habits. Have a look at our guideline to set [effective goals](/blog/goal-setting-techniques).


## The Compound Effect

The compound effect is the idea that small, consistent changes can lead to significant results over time. It's like the concept of compound interest, where small deposits can add up to a substantial amount over time.

So if you have business goal, example you want to increase your followers to over 80k, then you need to make content for these audience. Creating content is time consuming. At first, the amount of followers you gain per post will be minimal. As your content compiles over time, your followers will increase at an accelerated rate.

Similar situation is for engineers. When you start working on a new project in a new domain, your progress forward will be very slow. Following all the setup processes, reading over documentation, and understanding requirements is time-consuming. Over-time, as you compound your knowledge, repeating the same processes becomes much faster until it's a no-brainer.

So it‚Äôs all about making small efforts in the same domain for a long period of time. For you to effectively achieve this, you must know what niche you can focus on that you like. Figuring out what you want is often the hardest for many people. Once you do that, it‚Äôs all about [aligning your priorities with personal values](/blog/align-priorities-with-personal-values).
